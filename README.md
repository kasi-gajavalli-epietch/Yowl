YOWL is a web application that will allow users to comment on all of the content found on the
Internet. Each comment will be shared by the entire YOWL user community.

This tool makes it possible to decentralize comments from social networks and to have a new
vision of the web through participatory on sources (OSINT) or simply by adding a comment thus
federating communities around websites.
